## Overview
Physician Associate students at Yale are required to complete a thesis project in order to graduate. There is a required, year-long research class that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be successful in this endeavor. 

## Audience
Physician Associate students come from a range of educational, occupational, and demographic backgrounds. They are generally competent users of technology. 

## Design and deployment

Over the course of a year, I lead four sessions for the entire 40 student cohort and facilitate two rounds of six small group workshops. Over the years, they have taken place both in person and on Zoom. Many of the sessions have required pre-work to gauge student ability and confidence, as well as remind them of skills attained in the previous sessions. The sessions with the entire class feature polling, individual, and group activities to maintain engagement. The small group workshops alternate between mini lectures and structured activity time to have students walk away with concrete progress on their thesis projects. Every session is followed by a program-administered satisfaction survey and at the end of the year, there is a skills assessment.

## Overview

The physician associate profession has a long-documented lack of a scholarship culture. By and large, PAs practice, they teach &ndash; but they usually do not publish. The latest [PAEA faculty report](https://paeaonline.org/resources/public-resources/research-reports/faculty-directors-survey-and-reports) indicates fewer than half of PA faculty surveyed had ever authored a single paper. The Physician Associate Program at Yale is committed to producing PA leaders and competent researchers, primarily achieved through the completion of a yearlong research course and thesis project. 

However, baseline assessments of incoming cohorts each year reiterate that students are not equipped with the skills to successfully take on a thesis: most recently, 0% of students reported confidence in their ability to search the literature and 10% reported confidence using biomedical literature databases. 

In my role as library liaison to the PA programs, I partnered with faculty to develop and deliver a research skills curriculum that spans more than a year, incorporates a variety of pedagogical styles, and has been delivered synchronously, asynchronously, in-person, and online.

## Design and development

PA programs are compact &ndash; 2-2.5 years &ndash; so time in the classroom is scarce. 

I started by identifing the key skills needed to successfully complete a thesis based on my experience as an expert literature searcher, the thesis project handbook, and faculty consultation. 

After becoming acquainted with the previous models for research skills library instruction and learning more about what types of information and skills students learn when throughout the didactic and clinical curricula, I designed the following timeline:

After establishing the learning objectives for the entire series, I determined objectives at the session level. From here, I designed rough outlines for prework and synchonous time.

Flip through the initial Research II session plan:

Prework I created includes:
* Reviewing videos and handouts
* Reading patient scenarios and completing specific tasks
* Interactive matching activities

Here is one of the videos:

Each session was designed a little differently based on duration. Most included a combination of formative assessments (using polling technology or individual activities conducted in Google Forms that could be reviewed as a group in Summary View), small group activities, and miniature lectures/demonstrations. The Research I-III sequence sessions were built around patient scenarios relevant to the students' current didactic course. 

Here are the slides for the Research II session:

Workshops included a lot of guided work time, where I would suggest tools and tasks to explore during an indicated period and I would be available to help should any issues arise.

Here are the slides for the Thesis Proposal Workshops, where groups of 6-8 students come for two hours to scope out the literature on their potential thesis topics:

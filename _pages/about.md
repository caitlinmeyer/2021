I am an experienced instructor and instructional designer with a background in librarianship and communications. Iâ€™ve taught audiences from high school and undergraduate students to physicians and university faculty and am well-versed in creating engaging learning experiences in online, in person, and hybrid environments. I learn technology quickly, am detail-oriented, and am enthusiastic about taking on new challenges. 

Outside of work, I'm a self-taught illustrator, printmaker, and quilter. I'm big into hiking, camping, checking out [new breweries](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HfRg6F2EaqD8rMgdYwJWRZ6fwvU&usp=sharing), going to bluegrass festivals, and playing competetive pinball [(poorly)](http://crap.league.papa.org/playerInfo/113). 
 
I live in Connecticut with my husband, our dog, and an unruly vegetable garden.
